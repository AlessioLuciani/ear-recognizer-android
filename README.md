## External resources

For the ear detection task, we leverage the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers provided by IUSIANI. You may find them publicly available [here](https://github.com/DiUS/Physiognomy/tree/master/python/haarcascades) or [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/e33bfb5ebfcf51b5f15995c08fd68a6b2ecb2f1e/data/haarcascades).
