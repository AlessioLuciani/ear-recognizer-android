## External resources

For the ear detection task, we leverage the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers provided by IUSIANI. You may find them publicly available [here](https://github.com/DiUS/Physiognomy/tree/master/python/haarcascades) or [here](https://forge.univ-lyon1.fr/p1401778/anaimg2/-/tree/e99fef391d6ff72cdb9426c6d1d218d13aba344b/CascadeFiles).
